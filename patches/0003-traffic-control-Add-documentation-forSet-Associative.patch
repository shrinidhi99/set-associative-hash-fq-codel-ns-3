 and `fq-codel-queue-disc.cc` defining a FqCoDelQueueDisc class and a helper
 FqCoDelFlow class. The code was ported to |ns3| based on Linux kernel code
 implemented by Eric Dumazet.
+Set Associative Hash is also based on Linux kernel CAKE queue management code. 
+Set associative hashing is used to reduce the number of hash collisions in 
+comparison to choosing queues normally with a simple hash. For a given number of 
+queues, set-associative hash has fewer collisions in comparison to traditional 
+hash as long as the number of flows is fewer than the number of queues. 
+Essentially, it makes the queue management system more efficient. Set associative 
+hash is a vital component of CAKE, which is another popular flow management 
+algorithm that is also implemented in Linux and is being tested for FqCodel.
+Furthermore, this module can be directly used with CAKE when its other 
+components are implemented in ns-3. The only changes are in the 
+DoEnqueue function and are detailed below.
 
 * class :cpp:class:`FqCoDelQueueDisc`: This class implements the main FqCoDel algorithm:
 
-  * ``FqCoDelQueueDisc::DoEnqueue ()``: If no packet filter has been configured, this routine calls the QueueDiscItem::Hash() method to classify the given packet into an appropriate queue. Otherwise, the configured filters are used to classify the packet. If the filters are unable to classify the packet, the packet is dropped. Otherwise, it is handed over to the CoDel algorithm for timestamping. Then, if the queue is not currently active (i.e., if it is not in either the list of new or the list of old queues), it is added to the end of the list of new queues, and its deficit is initiated to the configured quantum. Otherwise,  the queue is left in its current queue list. Finally, the total number of enqueued packets is compared with the configured limit, and if it is above this value (which can happen since a packet was just enqueued), packets are dropped from the head of the queue with the largest current byte count until the number of dropped packets reaches the configured drop batch size or the backlog of the queue has been halved. Note that this in most cases means that the packet that was just enqueued is not among the packets that get dropped, which may even be from a different queue.

Note that this in most cases means that the packet that was just enqueued is not among the packets that get dropped, which may even be from a different queue. SetAssociative DoEnqueue works differently for a set-associative hash. The following paragraph details the working of set-associative hash and its use. In this implementation, we use 8-way set associativity to divide the queues into groups of 8. Call this group of 8 queues a set. The way ns-3 determines a queue is by taking the hash of the packet flow. We mainly use two hashes. FirstHash is generated from murmur3 by taking mod 1024. The second hash, which is the outerHash = firstHash - firsHash (mod 8), gives the first queue of the set which the flow should go into. Now, unlike Linux, there aren’t 1024 queues already existing in memory. So, when a new packet comes, queues are created as and when needed. However, to know the queue number, a map “m_flowsIndices” is created that maps the outer hash to the queue number.m_flowIndices plays an important role. Let’s say that flow hash modulo 1024 was 803. Linux would directly correspond this packet to the set containing queues 800-807 and put it in an empty queue. The existing implementation of fqCoDel in ns-3 did this by creating the first queue, indexed at 0, and assigning m_flowsIndices[803] to 0, but in our case, we need to maintain set information. One way to do this is to create new queues in such a way that eight queues together can be considered as a set. In our implementation, we create eight queues altogether if the set wasn’t already present. We store the index of the first queue in this set, inside m_flowsIndices[800] (which is 0). Now, there are 8 queues created, among which seven of them are empty. 800 is the outer hash generated through the above equation. Logically outer hash is the closest multiple of 8 less than 803 ). Now, say a packet with flow 805 comes in. Since it belongs to a set corresponding to 800, consequently has the same outer hash, and m_flowsIndices[800] is already set, our implementation now goes to queue 0, and searches iteratively in the next eight queues. Similar to Linux, we maintain a tags[] array, that allows us to determine the flow that is stored in a queue by mapping firstHash to the initial flowHash. To enable SetAssociativity, we also added a boolean attribute to the FqCoDel class named m_setAssociativeHash. When a collision occurs, if the packet is of a different flow than the ones in the set, we don’t consider creating new flows for the packet, since this approach might waste resources in the long run, or increasing the number of queues. A better approach is to enqueue the packet into the first queue. After adding the flow, the corresponding tag for that queue is updated to the flow hash of the newly enqueued packet. An example is if the set is already full and a 9th flow enters, then it is queued into the first queue of the set, and the tag is updated to be the hash of the 9th flow. The situation highlighted is a guaranteed collision and cannot be avoided without increasing the overall number of queues.
 
   * ``FqCoDelQueueDisc::DoDequeue ()``: The first task performed by this routine is selecting a queue from which to dequeue a packet. To this end, the scheduler first looks at the list of new queues; for the queue at the head of that list, if that queue has a negative deficit (i.e., it has already dequeued at least a quantum of bytes), it is given an additional amount of deficit, the queue is put onto the end of the list of old queues, and the routine selects the next queue and starts again. Otherwise, that queue is selected for dequeue. If the list of new queues is empty, the scheduler proceeds down the list of old queues in the same fashion (checking the deficit, and either selecting the queue for dequeuing, or increasing deficit and putting the queue back at the end of the list). After having selected a queue from which to dequeue a packet, the CoDel algorithm is invoked on that queue. As a result of this, one or more packets may be discarded from the head of the selected queue, before the packet that should be dequeued is returned (or nothing is returned if the queue is or becomes empty while being handled by the CoDel algorithm). Finally, if the CoDel algorithm does not return a packet, then the queue must be empty, and the scheduler does one of two things: if the queue selected for dequeue came from the list of new queues, it is moved to the end of the list of old queues.  If instead it came from the list of old queues, that queue is removed from the list, to be added back (as a new queue) the next time a packet for that queue arrives. Then (since no packet was available for dequeue), the whole dequeue process is restarted from the beginning. If, instead, the scheduler did get a packet back from the CoDel algorithm, it subtracts the size of the packet from the byte deficit for the selected queue and returns the packet as the result of the dequeue operation.

+The SetAssociative Hash is tested by generating a probability collision graph. This graph is then overlapped with the theoretical graph provided in the original CAKE Paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8475045. The exactness of the theoretical graph and the generated graph was assumed to be a proof of correctness. The generated graph is linked below:
